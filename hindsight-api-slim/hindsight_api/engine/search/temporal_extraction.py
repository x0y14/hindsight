# Temporal extraction is pure CPU, and recall calls it from an async request
# path. Running it inline blocks the event loop for the whole duration, which
# stalls every other in-flight request in the process — not just the recall
# doing the work. Measured with 16 concurrent extractions over document-sized
# text: the loop got a single scheduler tick in 1.3 seconds.
#
# It is offloaded to a thread instead. The pool is deliberately **one worker**.
# Japanese extraction may call MeCab via fugashi; MeCab releases the GIL, so
# extra workers would race on the shared Tagger (parse is already under a lock)
# and would not add parallelism. Keep max_workers=1; do not widen it.
# Measured, same 16 extractions:
#
#     inline              total= 1318ms   loop stall max=1318ms
#     max_workers=1       total= 1438ms   loop stall max=   2.8ms
#     max_workers=2       total= 2091ms   loop stall max=   4.5ms
#     max_workers=4       total= 4751ms   loop stall max=   6.3ms
#     unbounded           total=16688ms   loop stall max=  33.8ms
#
# One worker keeps throughput (+9%) while the loop stays responsive (470x), and
# preserves the serialisation the inline version already had. Anything wider
# trades throughput away for nothing.
